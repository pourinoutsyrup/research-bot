        "reasoning": "Engineering control theory provides a robust mathematical framework for dynamic systems, making it highly applicable to portfolio management as a feedback control problem. However, implementation is complex (low ease) due to the need for accurate system models and real-time parameter estimation. The potential for alpha is high (good tradability) through systematic risk management and adaptive allocation. The approach is novel as it moves beyond traditional statistical finance to an engineering systems perspective."

The potential alpha is immense for problems intractable for classical computers, and the approach is highly novel and unconventional."

        "reasoning": "Thermodynamic entropy provides a powerful conceptual framework for modeling market disorder, information flow, and the efficiency of capital distribution. While implementation is complex (low ease score) due to abstract analogies and data requirements, the potential for alpha is high as it offers a unique, non-equilibrium view of market states and regime changes. The approach is highly novel, moving beyond traditional financial models."

However, implementation is complex and data-intensive, limiting ease. The approach is highly novel and could potentially capture non-linear dynamics missed by traditional models, offering significant alpha if successfully parameterized."

        "reasoning": "Statistical mechanics provides frameworks for modeling complex systems with many interacting components, making it conceptually applicable to financial markets. However, implementation is difficult, requiring sophisticated modeling and calibration (low ease). The approach offers high potential for alpha by capturing emergent market phenomena and tail risks not modeled by traditional finance (high tradability). Using physics-based risk distributions is highly unconventional in mainstream finance (high novelty)."

        "reasoning": "Signal processing noise filtering is a direct and well-established analogy for financial data analysis. Implementation is moderately straightforward using existing DSP libraries, but requires careful parameterization. The potential for alpha is high as effective noise reduction can improve signal-to-noise ratios in trading signals. The approach is conceptually sound but not particularly novel, as filtering techniques (e.g., Kalman filters, bandpass filters) are already widely used in quantitative finance."
